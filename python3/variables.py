# Creating variables in python is as simple as assigning values to 
# any varibale.

# We will create a variable x by assigning a value of 5 to it.

x=5
print(x)

# We can slo create a variable to hold strings

y="Hello World" 
print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and 
# can even change type after they have been set.
# Ex:

z=4		# z is of type 'int'
z="Sally"	# z is of type 'str'
print(z)


# We can declare strings using '' or ""
# Ex. x= "John" is same as x='John'


# Case Sensitive: Python is case sensitive

p=5
P="John"
print(p)	# Here p & P are different variables!
print(P)

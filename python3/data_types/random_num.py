# Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in 
# module called random that can be used to make random numbers.

# To generate random numbers, we first need to import the module 'random'. We are then going 
# to generate a random number between 1 & 10.

import random
print(random.randrange(1,10))

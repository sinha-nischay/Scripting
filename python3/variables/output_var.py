# Here, we will look at different ways to produce output

# Simple output

x="Python is awesome"
print(x)


# Printing multiple variables' values
a="Python"
b="is"
c="awesome"
print(a,b,c)	

# We can also use + operator
# NOTE: '+' operator simply joins the variables. So we need to put
# spaces in each variable at the end. 

r="Python "		# Space put after Python
s="is "			# Space put after is
t="awesome "		# Space put after awesome
print(r+s+t)



# If variables are number, then + will perform addition
A=5
B=10
print(A+B)


# We can print numbers and alphabets together using ','
# NOTE: Using '+' for the same will give error 
X=5
Y="John"
print(X,Y)

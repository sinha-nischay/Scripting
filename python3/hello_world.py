# This is a simple hello world program in python

print("Hello World!")


# NOTE: Python can be run as a command line itself.
# To enter into python command line mode, just type 'python3' and hit enter
# Ex. You can directly write 'print("Hello Worldn 123")' on the command line
# and hit enter. It will give you an output of 'Hello World 123'.
# To exit the python command line mode, simply type 'exit()' and hit enter.

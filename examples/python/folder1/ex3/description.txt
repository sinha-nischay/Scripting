Ex.3:

In this example, we are going to rename a group of files to make them easily readable.

Here, we have a list of files, all .mp4 extensions, which are videos pf planets of our solar system.
However their names are not properly organised. Ex. Earth- Our Solar System - #4, etc.
We want them to be renamed as 4-Earth and so on.

To accomplish the same we are going to write a script.
